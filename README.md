# Problem 1: Find the Word

In this problem we have given a dictionary and the frequencey of each word as input. We have to find the word in the dictionary and if the word is present 
print "YES" and its frequency else if word is not present print "NO"

We will use Trie Data Structure inorder to solve the problem. Trie Data Structure is used to implement dictionary. 
We will read the CSV file and store all the values in a vector pair and pass the vector pair in out function.


## To run the code use C++ version 11
Step 1. Clone the repository 
Step 2. Make sure g++ is installed in the system and all the enviornment variable is set inorder to avoid any system error
Step 3. With the help of the terminal or cmd go the Dictionary folder which you have cloned.
Step 4. Type g++ FindWord.cpp   // This is basically used to compile the code
Step 5. Type .\a.exe // code run from this command
