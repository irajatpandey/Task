# Problem 1: Find the Word

In this problem we have given a dictionary and the frequencey of each word as input. We have to find the word in the dictionary and if the word is present 
print "YES" and its frequency else if word is not present print "NO"

We will use Trie Data Structure inorder to solve the problem. Trie Data Structure is used to implement dictionary. 
We will read the CSV file and store all the values in a vector pair and pass the vector pair in our function.


## To run the code use C++ version 11

Step 1. Clone the repository <br>
Step 2. Make sure g++ is installed in the system and all the enviornment variable is set inorder to avoid any system error<br>
Step 3. With the help of the terminal or cmd go the Dictionary folder which you have cloned.<br>
Step 4. Type g++ FindWord.cpp        // This is basically used to compile the code<br>
Step 5. Type .\a.exe                // code run from this command<br>


# Problem 2: ReverseSearch 
In this problem we have given a dictionary as CSV file and we will read CSV file in our Program. We will implement Trie using the given Dictionary.
Each node is associated with some integer and we have backtrace that node and find the exact word ending at that node.


## To run the code use C++ version 11 or higher version
Step 1. Clone the repository <br>
Step 2. G++ must be installed with all settings. <br>
Step 3. Go to the dictionary folder using cmd or terminal. <br>
Step 4. Type g++ ReverseSearch.cpp <br>
Step 5. Type .\a.exe <br>


# FrontEnd 
We have to make a signup form which includes filed like FirstName, LastName, Email, Password
